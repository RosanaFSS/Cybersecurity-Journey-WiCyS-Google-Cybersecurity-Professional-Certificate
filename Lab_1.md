<h2>Task 1 - Ensure that APT is installed</h2>
<p>First, you’ll check that the APT application is installed so that you can use it to manage applications. The simplest way to do this is to run the apt command in the Bash shell and check the response.<br>

The Bash shell is the command-line interpreter currently open on the left side of the screen. You’ll use the Bash shell by typing commands after the prompt. The prompt is represented by a dollar sign ($) followed by the input cursor.</p>

<p>Confirm that the APT package manager is installed in your Linux environment. To do this, type apt after the command-line prompt and press ENTER.
When installed, apt displays basic usage information when you run it. This includes the version information and a description of the tool:</p>

<p>APT is already installed by default in the Linux Bash shell in this lab because this is a Debian-based system. APT is also the recommended package manager for Debian. If you’re using another distribution, a different package manager, such as YUM, may be available instead.</p>
